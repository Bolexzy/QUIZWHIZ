 # Since we are using a document based NoSQL database, i have proposed a schema for the sake of consistency.

## The "users" collection:
- the documents in this collection should have the following structure:
```
{
    "_id": string -> autogenerated
	"user_id": string
    "user_name": string
    "profile_url": string
	"email": string,-> required
	"password": string, -> required
	"role": string [user/admin] -> defaults to user
	"isVerified": string
}
```

## The "Questions" collection:
- the documents in this collection should have the following structure:
```
{
    "test_id": string,
    "user_id": string,
    "title": string,
    "description": string,
    "alloted_time_mins": int,
    "quiz_start_time": int,  //(unix epoch timestamp in milliseconds as in javascript)
    "quiz_end_time": int,  //(unix epoch timestamp in milliseconds as in javascript)
    "questions": [array of question objects (see below)],
}
```

- A question object has the following structure:
```
{
    "id": string, -> required
    "question": string, -> required
    "options":{   		-> required
        "A": string,
        "B": string,
        "C": string,
        "D": string,
    },
    "answer": [an array os strings] -> required
}
```

## The "results" collection:
- the documents in this collection should have the following structure:
```
{
    "test_id" : string,
    "user_id": string,
    "user_name": string,
    "profile_url": string,
    "date_taken" : int,  //(unix epoch timestamp in milliseconds as in javascript),
    "total_questions" : int,
    "right_answers" : int,
}
```
